We operate a small shop from our Seed Hut offering competitively-priced seeds, fertilisers, bulbs and other related materials to our Members at a discount.
 
Please note that our shop is run on a non-profit, volunteer-led basis by our Members, for our Members. The shop is typically open from 10:30 to 11:30 on Saturdays and Sundays.
