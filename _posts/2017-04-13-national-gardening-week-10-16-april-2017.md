Visit the [RHS's National Gardeners Week website](http://www.nationalgardeningweek.org.uk/) to see what is going on in your area.

There are lots of fun things to join in with or organize your own.

Some Ideas.

- Hold a garden party and invite your friends and neighbours.
- Hold a cake sale or a sponsored weeding marathon to raise money for the local school's Gardening Club.
- Organize some family fun in the park. Get children to make a paper pot and plant a sunflower seed.
