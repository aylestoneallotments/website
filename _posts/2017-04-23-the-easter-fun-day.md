<p>Thanks for all the preparation before and effort on the day.</p>
<p>So many things went well I refuse to list them out.</p>
<p>However, the Easter bonnet show was definitely the most exciting ever. I have decided that I will enter a hat next year, maybe to match my waistcoat.</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

We'll keep you to that Malc.

<blockquote>
<p>So many people turned up, the hut was overflowing and people were outside. It was great. Thanks so much to Abi and Caz, as well as Malc, Mike and Jim.We were stopped outside the gates as we left by a member who said it was the best Easter event that he could remember!</p>
