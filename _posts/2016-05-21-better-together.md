Nature prefers diversity; take a look anywhere that she is left to her own devices and you will see evidence of this: from the dandelions and daisies that spring up in your lawn, to the bistort and buddleia that bring life to abandoned waste ground. Just like people, different plants have different needs, and having a mix of plants in our soils means that this precious resource is never over-exploited.

As anyone who has had neighbours will know, there are those whom we get on with, and those who rub us up the wrong way. This is also true of plants.

Those that are beneficial to each other are known as ‘companions’, and those that have negative effects are known as ‘antagonists’.

Growing a single crop in the same place year-on-year can have deleterious consequences for the environment. Soils are quickly exhausted of nutrients, diseases proliferate, and pests come to know when they’re on to a good thing in no time. Crop rotation uses the principles of companion planting, but with a long-term view in order to avoid this.

But why wait, fellow allotmenteer, when you can experience the benefits of companion planting immediately? By incorporating companion plants and polycultures into your growing, you can increase yield, reduce pests, and add a touch of colour to even the shadiest parts of your plot.

### In Pictures: A Traditional Four Year Crop Rotation

This isn’t a new phenomenon or a fancy theory; examples can be found throughout history the world over, from the Native American Iroquois and their use of the ‘Three Sisters’, to the Mediterranean tradition of growing basil between tomatoes or aubergines.

Simple companion plants you can introduce to your plot immediately include:

Nasturtiums: though vigorous, these are an excellent ‘sacrificial’ crop to attract aphids away from your beans. They are edible, grow attractive flowers, and the seeds are wonderful when pickled!

Sunflowers: These provide both shade and support when intercropped with cucumbers. They also make lovely cut flowers, and the seed heads double up as nature’s answer to the bird feeder (if you can refrain from nibbling them yourself)!

Lettuce: try interplanting between your brassicas – plants are happier together, and the extra ground cover will prevent weeds and increase yield. You may wish to leave some lettuces as a sacrificial crop to lure slugs away from your maincrop, too.

Marigold (tagetes): These are excellent alongside your tomatoes or potatoes. They have a pungent scent that deters many common pests, including nematodes and eelworm.

Calendula: Confusingly known as ‘pot marigold’, this is a different species to the tagetes. Sow a mix of calendula and cornflowers in your borders to attract a host of beneficial pollinators, as well as beneficial predators such as hoverflies, lacewings and ladybirds.
