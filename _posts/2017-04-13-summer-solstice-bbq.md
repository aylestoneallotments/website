**Saturday 24 June 2017**

The Summer should be here.
The days are Longer.

This year we hope to celebrate the Summer Solstice with our Summer BBQ

Tickets will be available nearer the date. There will only be a limited number of tickets that are available on the day, and these will be sold on a 'First Come First Served' basis and when they are gone they are gone. The meat for the BBQ has to be bought before the BBQ starts. We can't just pop out and buy more if more people just turn up. Don't be disappointed, buy your tickets when they go on sale.
