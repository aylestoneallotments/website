## Hobby Flowers for Cutting and Arranging

The next in Mick Eaton's series of highly-informed and popular Masterclasses is this coming Saturday, the 4th of June 2016.

This class has been arranged in response to a number of requests asking Mick to repeat last year's talk which proved the most popular talk of the season. Whilst delivering his lecture Mick will be putting together flower arrangements; he did two last year, which were then raffled off at the end of the talk.

This is an opportunity for members to bring along their guests to enjoy a master arranging flowers and to pick up tips on how to put together a stunning display with the minimum of material.

The Masterclass starts at 11:00 in the Seed Hut. Members and their guests are welcome!
