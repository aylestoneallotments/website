AALGS is run by an elected committee. Usually meeting at the seed hut these meetings are an opportunity for the committee to discuss the issues for members, finances and anything related to the day-to-day running of the society.

All Society members are free to attend Committee meetings. We can choose
to have them off-site but need to inform all our members beforehand.
