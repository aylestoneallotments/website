This Sunday, 14 August 2016, Maggie Frankum invites our members to take part in one of her brilliant bee walks - _Buzzing About the Allotments_.

If you're an AALGS member who is curious about bees, and you would like to know more about the different species that you see on your plot, join Maggie this Sunday at 11am at the Seed Hut.

_Maggie Frankum is a local naturalist and wildlife gardener, as well as being a member of the Bumblebee Conservation Trust; Friend of the University of Leicester Botanic Garden Entomological Society; Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust._
