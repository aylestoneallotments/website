title: 'It''s Bumble Time Again at A.A.L.G.S. '
---
Flowers need bumbles [for pollination]; bumbles need flowers [nectar to power flight, and pollen - protein for developing young]; and gardeners need both for the  flowers, fruit and vegetables that we grow - courgettes, tomatoes, beans, raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, apples, pears &  plumsâ€¦

Why not join us again and enjoy a Saturday morning potter around the allotments, to spot wild bumblebees in action?

[start: Big  Shed, 11am until ca 12.30pm]

- Walk No.1, 	17th June 2017 	
- Walk No.2, 	15th July 2017
- Walk No.3.	12th August 2017

Find out more about them: - how to catch and identify them; their life cycles; what flowers to grow to entice them with nectar and pollen etc; and unwittingly in return, they will carry out the important role of pollination of the flowers, fruit and veggies that we grow and rely on.

**Bumbles still need our continued understanding and support.**
