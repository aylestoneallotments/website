Dear Fellow Allotmenteers,

First and foremost, a big thank-you to all those who came to this year’s AGM. It was great to see new faces, but it would be even better to see more of you next year. The Society is what we make of it as a community – and together, we’re stronger. The AGM is your chance to have your voice heard, and, crucially, to play your part in its future.

### Seeds of Change

Giant Pumpkin seeds will go on sale very soon – come and buy some, all proceeds will go to Gardening for the Disabled. Likewise, we will have some Giant Sunflower seedlings for sale, kindly provided by Mick Eaton – all proceeds go to the above charity. All pumpkins and sunflowers will be judged on Rent Day for weight and size.

### Notes from the AGM

This year, we discussed the new Rules that will come into action as of 30th March 2016, as outlined in the AGM letter. The Rules were passed by a majority, with one amendment conceded, relating to the maintenance of the road edge of plots. Plot fronts must now be kept clear by 3ft in order to protect underground water pipes.

A couple of reminders to Members Carpets are no longer allowed to be used as ground cover. Synthetic carpets are not biodegradable and are threatening to the health of our soils. They’re also an ideal breeding ground for rats and other vermin, so please, help us to keep our site healthy by removing any that is present on your site.

__On that note, if you have tyres on your site, these need to be removed as they are not allowed, either.__
