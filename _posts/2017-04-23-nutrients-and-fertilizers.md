For successful uptake of fertilizer (plant food) there must be sufficient moisture in the soil. This is usually held within the organic matter that acts rather like a sponge. Therefore most successful gardeners will add this in the form of manure or compost in the winter.

The three main plant foods are -

__NITROGEN__ – Promotes stem and leaf growth
__PHOSPHOROUS__ – Promotes root growth
__POTASSIUM__ – Promotes fruit, flowers, ripening and flower colour

Other elements include: Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Boron and others. In general we do not have to worry about these too much if we use organic matter such as manure and compost.

__MANURE__
Usually contain a cocktail of elements but in variable quantities. Their main value is in their sponge like nature that will make heavy ground more friable and thin soils more moisture retentive.

__COMPOST HEAP__
Similar to manure, but if properly rotted down can be used at any time of the year.

__GREEN MANURE__
Quick growing crop that is dug into the ground in its entirety usually before it is full grown. Examples include Mustard, Clover, Field Beans and Annual Lupins. Vetches and other legumes have the added advantage of nitrogen fixing nodules on the roots that release their nitrogen on decomposition making it available for the next crop.
