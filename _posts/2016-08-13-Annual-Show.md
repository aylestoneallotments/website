## Annual Show - Saturday 20th August 2016

It's that time of year again, folks! We're looking forward to celebrating the season with you for our Annual Show on Saturday 20th August 2016. There are classes to suit every kind of grower, so don't be shy!

Take a look at [our schedule](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6XKQax98VJTaHljQ05iSkFyQ0U/view) and consider which produce you wish to enter this year. The event is lots of fun for all the family.

We are looking for a volunteer steward to help facilitate the show, so please get in touch if you can help!
