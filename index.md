## A friendly community of gardeners with over one hundred years of history

Aylestone Allotments and Leisure Gardeners Society works to promote gardening and vegetable growing. We have a more than a hundred members and [a site](/about/find-us) with 200 rentable plots.

We are a sociable organisation where experienced and novice gardeners are equally welcome. We run educational talks, regular social events and have our own shop.
