# Welcome to Aylestone Allotments

### We have been around for more than one hundred years and we have more than one hundred members.

Our allotments are situated at the junction of Whittier Road and Copinger Road, at the corner of Aylestone Recreation Ground. (See satellite view.)

AALGS is run by an elected committee and is a friendly, sociable organisation where experienced and novice gardeners are equally welcome.

We are so popular that our membership is currently full. However, if you are interested in an allotment, please contact us and we can add you to the waiting list.
