## A welcoming community of gardeners

Aylestone Allotments and Leisure Gardeners' Society works to promote gardening and vegetable growing. We have more than a hundred members and [an allotment site](/about/find-us) with 200 rentable plots.

We are a sociable organisation on a site where experienced and novice gardeners are equally welcome. We run educational talks, regular social events and have our own shop.
