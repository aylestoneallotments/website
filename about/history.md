There are 200 rentable plots on the site. The majority of plots are 300 square yards in size but a few are let as starter plots and are about 100 square yards in size. These are ideal for the ‘first timer’ or someone who just wants a ‘back garden’ size plot.
 
A 300 sq yd plot should feed a family of four all year if cultivated correctly.
 
Our biggest let is of 65 plots to a community project called the Saffron Acres Project. This project has a full time leader, Louise Williams, and has the aim of providing fruit and vegetables to feed a local community luncheon club for the elderly. Various schools, clubs and voluntary bodies have shown a big interest in the project and help out when they can.
 
We are a very mixed bunch of gardeners of all age groups from under-10s coming every week to ‘help’ dig to 85 years-young ones coming most days to ‘do a bit’. There are quite a lot of lady gardeners on site as well.
 
We have a Community focal point, namely the ‘Seed Hut’ where we sell tea and coffee. We also sell seed, fertilisers, potatoes, flowering bulbs etc with plenty of advice on how to plant them. The Hut is open at the weekends and sometimes in the week in the summer.
 
We also hold our social events there through the year.
 
At the moment (Spring 2012) we are fully let but we do have a waiting list . The next time that we may have some vacancies will be after ‘Rent day’ in October. This is the usual time that we have members leaving us. If you feel that you would like to join us then please contact the Secretary.
